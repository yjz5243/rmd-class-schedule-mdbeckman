# Activity: Markdown Class Schedule

- Use the template document `ClassScheduleActivity.Rmd` to create a document that describes **at least three classes** you are currently taking in Fall 2018.  (Note: If you are taking fewer than 3 classes, you may describe jobs or other responsibilities for additional entries)
- Students are recommended to use the RStudio Server to complete this assignment
- Students in this section of STAT 184 may help from one another, but each student must submit his/her own original work to be graded.
- You should be able to get by with pretty basic use of Git/GitHub, but you will want to learn and configure these tools as soon as possible.  Here's the best tutorial I know about [http://happygitwithr.com/](http://happygitwithr.com/)
- Help each other, share Rmd tips, post questions/answers/syntax to Piazza!
